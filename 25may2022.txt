How to Calculate Time Complexity of an Algorithm + Solved Questions (With Notes)
In previous videos, 
we had discussed what time complexity is and 
how it helps in dealing with what is most efficient for our programs. 
Our task today will be to find out how to calculate 
the time complexity of our programs. 
Here are some tips and tricks about the same, 
followed by a discussion of some questions
